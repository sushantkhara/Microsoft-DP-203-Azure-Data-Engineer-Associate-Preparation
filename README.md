## Dear Readers! 
## If you find any of the answers from the dumps confusing or wrong kindly follow up and stick to teh concepts not the answers.

## For more help on exam preparation the course I will recommend is - Instructor Alan Rodrigues DP-203 course
https://www.udemy.com/course/data-engineering-on-microsoft-azure/

## Just understand the basic concepts well about the several azure services and tools about what is it, when to use, why to use and scenario based issues to be solved using them.
## I hope you crack it! Good Luck!
